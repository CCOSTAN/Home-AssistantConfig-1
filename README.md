# Home Assistant Configuration
This is how my Home Assistant configuration is set up. Hope this can be for inspiration for other users of the platform, as the many other repositories on GitHub has helped me on my home automation journey.

The setup is running on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, and as of this commit it is running on HA version __0.66.1__.

This is how my default view looks, where I can controll the most important stuff.
